\*\*\*\*![](.gitbook/assets/near-protocol.png) **About Near** **Protocol**: NEAR \(aka ‚Äúthe NEAR Platform‚Äù\)? NEAR is a decentralized development platform built on top of the NEAR Protocol, which is a public, sharded, developer-friendly, proof-of-stake blockchain. Put another way, NEAR is like a public community-run cloud platform. That means it is a highly scalable, low-cost platform for developers to create decentralized apps on top of. While it‚Äôs built on top of the NEAR Protocol blockchain, the NEAR Platform also contains a wide range of tooling from explorers to CLI tools to wallet apps to interoperability components which help developers build much more easily and the ecosystem to scale more widely.
